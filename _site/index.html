            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Working on the Internet of Things team, I make sure that our web application is able to communicate with many hardwares devices installed by customers. My main responsibility is to develop a scalable, reliable and maintainable backend that consists of well tested & documented APIs, messaging queues for reliability and a distributed search engine for scalability and full text search.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Besides working on the core backend application of Arquivei, as Junior Developer I also worked on building from scratch a microservice that uses Golang's concurrency as its core. This microservice was built to parse multiple incoming documents and store them on a distributed search engine, which could be read as requested. All the requests were saved as logs for auditing and everything  was real time monitored.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Working was an intern taught me a lot about software engineering, how to work on a team of developers and a lot about web development. My main responsibilities were to develop new features, review my colleague's code, prepare tests and write scripts to run in production. Since the company's focus was on storing documents, I had to opportunity to lean a lot about web infrastructure, from storing, queuing and running serverless applications.</p>

        <p>Generated new visualization tools for the Embraer E-Jet E2 family to help on the flight test campaign. Data was processed using Python and Matlab while results were updated on a web page using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP and mySQL. This position has allowed me to strengthen my coding skills while learning how to build tools from scratch.</p>

        </div>
        <p>By being an intern at the Localization & Documentation team, I learned and worked on software testing for the main security products of the company to ensure quality of the services in all available languages. It was interesting to see how it is to work at a multinational company and also to see the finnish culture at work. I also worked with Latin America’s Team to improve translations for marketing purposes.</p>
